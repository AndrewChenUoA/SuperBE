SuperBE

Dependencies:
- OpenCV 3.1.0
- CMake 2.8

Instructions:
Use SuperBE.cpp to write your test program, instantiating a superbe_engine object (described in superbe_core.cpp).
The second argument of superbe_engine.process_frame() can be set to 0 in order to visually show the results.
Use check_segmentation (described in analysis.cpp) to test SuperBE output images against a ground truth.
